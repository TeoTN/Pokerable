Pokerable
=========
v 1.0

Program contains both client and server class. Server is like "poker table" with both deck, players' cards and so on.
You set up server like this: java Main.java server 2267 (Where last parameter is port number)
You set up client like this: java Main.java client 127.0.0.1 2267 (Where last parameter is port number and previous one is server IP)

Cards are described as 'CA' (Ace of Clubs), 'H5', 'ST', etc.
Cards values: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,T,J,Q,K,A
Color characters: S (Spades), C (Clubs), H (Hearts), D (Diamonds)

Client can be created as bot (type "bot" after starting client process). It's playing pretty well (but there isn't any super-math, so do not worry).

Try to have fun. GUI is on the go.
