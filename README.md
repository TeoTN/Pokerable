You set up server like this: java Main.java server 2267 (Where last parameter is port number)  
You set up client like this: java Main.java client 127.0.0.1 2267 (Where last parameter is port number and previous one is server IP)  

Cards are described as 'CA' (Ace of Clubs), 'H5', 'ST', etc.  
Cards values: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,T,J,Q,K,A  
Color characters: S (Spades), C (Clubs), H (Hearts), D (Diamonds)  

Client can be created as bot (type "bot" after starting client process). It's playing pretty well (but there isn't any super-math, so do not worry).  

Try to have fun. GUI is on the go.
